# Project 02 for the University of Tulsa's CYB-3053: Operating Systems Concept course

## Please review the Project handout for full assignment details.

## Additional Instructions

Use the same environment you used for Project 1 (WSL, a Linux VM, Cygwin, other). We will not be building support for Windows.

Ensure that you obtain all files, preferably through a git clone.

To compile: At the top-level directory (where you should see CMakeLists.txt, build.sh, and src/), execute the build.sh file ("./build.sh" in your terminal, without quotes).

A new directory called "build" should have been created. Run your program by navigating to this directory and executing cyb3053_project2 ("./cyb3053_project2" in your terminal, without quotes).

## Requirements

A compiler (you likely installed gcc for Project 1 - this will work for this Project as well).

CMake (if you used the default environment for WSL, you will likely be able to obtain this with "sudo apt install cmake")
